2. Basic Syntax and Data Types
------------------------------------
   - Variables and Data Types: Introduce different data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, etc.) and how to declare variables.
   - Constants and Literals: Explain the use of `#define` and `const` to define constants.
   - Input and Output: Teach `printf()` and `scanf()` for basic I/O operations.

3. Operators and Expressions
---------------------------------
   - Arithmetic Operators: Discuss addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
   - Relational and Logical Operators: Cover comparison operators and logical operators.
   - Assignment Operators: Explain assignment and compound assignment operators.
   - Increment and Decrement Operators: Discuss `++` and `--`.
   - Bitwise Operators: Explain AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift.
   - Ternary Operator: Introduce the conditional (`?:`) operator.

4. Control Flow
-----------------
   - Conditional Statements: Teach `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch` statements.
   - Loops: Explain `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
   - Break and Continue: Discuss how to control loop execution with `break` and `continue`.
   - Goto Statement: Introduce `goto` (while also discussing why itâ€™s generally avoided).

5. Functions
--------------
   - Introduction to Functions: Define what functions are and their purpose.
   - Function Declaration and Definition: Explain how to declare and define functions.
   - Function Parameters and Return Values: Discuss passing arguments by value and returning values.

6. Arrays and Strings
------------------------
   - Introduction to Arrays: Explain single-dimensional arrays and their applications.
   - Multi-dimensional Arrays: Discuss two-dimensional arrays with examples like matrices.
   - String Handling: Introduce string manipulation, including `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcmp()`, and other string functions.

7. Pointers
-------------
   - Introduction to Pointers: Explain what pointers are and how they work.
   - Pointer Arithmetic: Discuss how to perform arithmetic on pointers.
   - Pointers and Arrays: Explain the relationship between pointers and arrays.
   - Pointers and Functions: Discuss passing pointers to functions.
   - Dynamic Memory Allocation: Introduce `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` for dynamic memory management.
   - Pointers to Pointers: Discuss double pointers and their applications.

8. Structures and Unions
----------------------------
   - Introduction to Structures: Explain what structures are and how to define them.
   - Nested Structures: Discuss structures within structures.
   - Arrays of Structures: Show how to use arrays of structures.
   - Pointers to Structures: Explain how to use pointers with structures.
   - Unions: Introduce unions and explain the difference between structures and unions.
   - Enums: Explain enumerated types and their usage.

9. File Handling
-----------------
   - Introduction to File I/O: Discuss the need for file handling in C.
   - Opening and Closing Files: Explain `fopen()`, `fclose()`, and file modes.
   - Reading and Writing Files: Teach `fgetc()`, `fputc()`, `fgets()`, `fputs()`, `fread()`, and `fwrite()`.
   - File Positioning: Explain `fseek()`, `ftell()`, and `rewind()`.

10. Advanced Topics
-----------------------
   - Command Line Arguments: Discuss how to handle command-line arguments in C.
   - Preprocessor Directives: Explain macros, `#define`, `#include`, and conditional compilation (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`).
   - Memory Management: Dive deeper into memory management, discussing stack vs. heap, and common pitfalls like memory leaks.
   - Dynamic Data Structures: Introduce linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
   - Bit Manipulation: Discuss advanced bitwise operations and their applications.

11. Debugging and Error Handling
---------------------------------------
   - Introduction to Debugging: Explain the importance of debugging and how to use debugging tools (like GDB).
   - Common Errors: Discuss common C programming errors and how to avoid them.
   - Error Handling: Teach techniques for handling errors gracefully.

12. Projects and Real-world Applications
---------------------------------------------
   - Mini Projects: Encourage students to apply what they've learned by working on small projects like a simple calculator, file-based student management system, or tic-tac-toe game.
   - Final Project: Guide students to build a comprehensive project that integrates multiple concepts, such as a text editor, a simple shell, or a basic database management system.

13. Conclusion and Best Practices
--------------------------------------
   - Code Readability and Comments: Emphasize the importance of writing clean, readable code and proper commenting.
   - Modular Programming: Teach how to break down a large program into smaller, reusable modules.
   - Optimizing C Code: Discuss tips for optimizing C code for performance and memory usage.
   - Industry Standards and Practices: Introduce students to coding standards like MISRA C, and best practices followed in the industry.

14. Revision and Practice
----------------------------
   - Revision Sessions: Regularly review previous topics to reinforce learning.
   - Practice Problems: Provide a variety of problems to solve that reinforce the concepts taught.
   - Mock Interviews and Quizzes: Conduct quizzes and mock interviews to prepare students for job placements and competitive exams.
